Cheesy Fiesta Potatoes is known to throw some major A-list ragers at his house. Unlike those relatives of his, Fiesta Potatoes likes to keep a balance. The reduced-fat sour cream topping keeps it cool, but not pretentious cool like Cool Beans, who just sits in the corner and criticizes every band’s most recent record for being too well-produced. Cheesy Fiesta Potatoes is cool like sending invites to all his friends and always wanting to put others first and making sure everyone is having a good time at one of his parties. He’s cool because his parties are filled with the people you want to know in the industry. So, he often has up-and-coming bands perform at his parties in hopes to help them get discovered. He loves to be a helping hand to people. However, Fiesta Potatoes’ other topping, nacho cheese sauce, shows the wild side. How wild? Well, why don’t you ask yourself that same question, Johnny? How wild do you think the Cheesy Fiesta Potatoes gets? Imagine a rager of a party, but remember he knows all the A-listers in the industry so you know it begins classy and elegant but as the night goes on, it just gets out of hand. You’ll witness Crunchwrap Supreme® slide down the staircase. Quesarito cannonballing in the pool in his trunks (because he comes prepared when he parties) and he splashes everyone who is small-talking around the pool. Soft Taco will be chatting it up by the bonfire talking about her latest European excursion. But with all this wildness, it’s still not as wild as the perpetually unpredictable cousin Kooky Corn, who we still haven’t heard from since she went to Reno a few weeks ago...",

Something you know is destined for greatness but it just needs that extra push to really make it mystical and supernatural. Then, you realize what that extra something is and you magically turn it into your favorite food after only a few seconds. That’s all, a few seconds. Oh, you don’t believe in magic, huh? Well, this just got awkward. Would you like a handful of cold potato shavings with your skepticism? No? How about potato chips? Exactly. Do you want this piece of bread shaped like a tire? Gross. Well how about a donut? Boom. Willing to walk away from the latest deep fried concoction at the county fair? Yeah, that’s what we thought. This is what you get with the Chalupa: beautiful witchcraft. All it’s magicalness in one perfect package. Take a traditional flatbread, something already awesome in its own right, and fry it. How does the saying go? Everything is better fried? Something like that, right. Or so we’re told. Once the flatbread is fried, you suddenly have a shell that mysteriously marries chewy and crispy; pure sorcery and pure perfection. Hold onto your wand because we’re not done yet. Fill the flatbread shell with seasoned beef, a three-cheese blend, lettuce, tomatoes, and reduced fat sour cream, and you get a Dante-esque culinary anomaly. You get the Chalupa Supreme. The only greater fried magic trick known to man is turning arbitrary dough splashes, into funnel cake. Now that is nothing short of a miracle. Neither is the Chalupa Supreme. Try one, we dare you.
